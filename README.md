# Automated-Excel-Parser

I created this code to iterate over 'New Product' excel files in a directory. The files were not in a standardized format, often had spelling and grammatical errors, and contained varying product types, sizes, and colors. I needed a fast way to exctract the product information from a given file, sort it, and list it to new files (one file for each product category.)
